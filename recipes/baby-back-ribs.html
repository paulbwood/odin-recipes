                <br>
                <h3>Ingredients</h3>        
                
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 tablespoon ground cumin</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon chili powder</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                        <li>3 pounds baby back pork ribs</li>
                        <li>1 cup barbeque sauce</li>
                    </ul>  
                    
                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
                        <li>Preheat a gas grill for high 
                            heat, or arrange charcoal briquettes 
                            on one side of the barbeque. Lightly 
                            oil the grate.</li>
                        <li>Combine cumin, chili powder, paprika,
                             salt, and pepper in a small jar; close
                              the lid and shake to mix.</li>
                        <li>Trim the membrane sheath from the back 
                            of each rack. Run a small, sharp knife 
                            between the membrane and each rib, and 
                            snip off the membrane as much as possible.</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle as much of the rub onto both sides 
                            of ribs as desired. To prevent ribs from 
                            becoming too dark and spicy, do not thoroughly
                            rub spices into ribs. Store any unused spice 
                            mix in a jar for future use.</li>
                        <li>Place aluminum foil on the lower rack to 
                            capture drippings and prevent flare-ups. 
                            Lay ribs on the top rack of the grill 
                            (away from the coals, if you're using briquettes). 
                            Reduce gas heat to low and close the lid; cook ribs,
                             undisturbed as possible, until meat pulls away 
                             easily from the bone, about 1 hour. An instant-read
                            thermometer inserted into the center should 
                            read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
                        <li>Brush ribs with barbecue sauce, and grill for an 
                            additional 5 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Serve ribs as a whole rack, or cut between each rib 
                            bone and pile individually on a platter.</li>
                    </ol>
